In order to connect Wayfair to Plentymarkets, you need to enter API credentials. To receive them, you must first send an email to ERPSupport@wayfair.com and provide the following information:

- Subject : Access to Plentymarkets plugin / "Name of your company" (SuID)
- Information contact
- Which functionalities you plan to use.

You will shortly receive an email back, containing a confirmation that you have been granted access to the API tools, as well as your **Supplier ID(s)**. Next, you need to head over to your Extranet account at partners.wayfair.com. In the banner, you should see a tab named "Developer". If you donâ€™t see it in the banner, then hover over the "More" tab, and it should appear in the dropdown menu.

Hover over the "Developer" tab, and click on "Application". You should be redirected to a new page. On this new page, click on the button named " + New Application", and give a name and description to your application

Click on "Save", then you should be shown a ClientID and Client Secret, which are the credentials you will need to use for the Wayfair plugin. Save these somewhere secure, especially the Client Secret, as you will only be able to see it once.
