# Wayfair Plugin: Wayfair Market Settings
The Wayfair plugin comes with a collection of settings for controlling the plugin's behavior.
These settings should only be configured after the [authorization settings for the plugin](initial_setup.md#1-authorizing-the-wayfair-plugin-to-access-wayfair-interfaces) have been configured for the active Plugin Set.

## Opening the settings page
To locate the settings:
1. Log in to Plentymarkets as a user with administrative rights
2. Click `Setup` in the top navigation bar of Plentymarkets
3. Click `Markets` in the left navigation bar of the `Settings` interface
4. Click `Wayfair` in the list of `Markets`. It may appear at the bottom, rather than being alphabetically situated.
5. Click `Home` under `Wayfair`
6. You may now use the Wayfair navigation bar to choose a settings page such as [`Warehouses`](#warehouses-page).

## Home page
The `Home` page is activated by clicking `Home` in the left-side menu or by clicking `Wayfair` in the Wayfair navigation bar. Currently, it provides no information.

## Warehouses page
The Warehouses page is used for associating the Warehouses that the supplier is using in Plentymarkets with the Wayfair Supplier IDs that have been issued to the supplier. The mappings are utilized by the Wayfair plugin when it reports inventory to Wayfair and also when it is processing Wayfair orders coming into Plentymarkets.

### Notes about Multiple Warehouses per Wayfair Supplier ID
The topography of the Plentymarkets system may not match the amount of Wayfair Supplier IDs. It is acceptable to use a Wayfair Supplier ID for more than one of the Plentymarkets Warehouses, but **this may cause unexpected behavior.** For instance, **the Wayfair plugin may not be able to determine the correct Warehouse to use for incoming orders** - see https://github.com/wayfair-contribs/plentymarkets-plugin/issues/92 for more information.


When choosing a relationship between Warehouses and Supplier IDs that is not one-to-one, make sure to review the behavior of the [Stock Buffer](#stock-buffer) setting.

### Adding a Warehouse mapping
1. Click on the `Add Mapping` button
2. Use the left column to choose a Plentymarkets Warehouse by name
3. Use the right column to enter a numeric Supplier ID
4. Click the `Save` button once the new row(s) have been completed

### Removing a Warehouse mapping
1. Locate the row to be removed
2. Click on the `delete` button ![delete icon](../../../images/icon_trash_can.png) in the row
3. Click the `Save` button once the desired row(s) have been removed


## Settings page
The Settings page contains general settings for the operation of the Wayfair plugin.
Settings do not automatically save when changed. Use the `Save` button at the bottom of the page.

### Stock Buffer
The `Stock Buffer` setting is a non-negative integer that sets a reserved amount of stock for each Item Variation, for each Wayfair Supplier ID. The buffer amount is subtracted after all other stock calculations are made, including aggregating the stocks for multiple Plentymarkets Warehouses that have been assigned the same Wayfair Supplier ID.

To disable the `Stock Buffer`, leave this setting empty, or set it to `0`.

### Default Order Status
The `Default Order Status` setting determines which state a new Plentymarkets Order should be in after creation by the Wayfair plugin.

**Notice:** The Order creation does not qualify as an Order state change. Setting `Default Order Status` to a value higher than configured Plentymarkets Order Actions may prevent said Actions from taking place!

### Default Shipping Provider **(deprecated)**
The `Default Shipping Provider` setting is a legacy setting that no longer impacts the behavior of the plugin.
**If this setting appears in your system, Wayfair strongly recommends that you upgrade your plugin to a newer version.**

### Item Mapping Method
The `Item Mapping Method` setting determines the behavior for matching the Plentymarkets Item Variations to the Wayfair Products. It is used when the inventory listings are sent to Wayfair, and also to select the requested products in a Wayfair Purchase Order. The Plentymarkets user should configure this setting to match the way their Item Variations are populated.

By default, the `Variation Number` field is used for mapping Wayfair Orders' items to Plentymarkets Item Variations.
The other options are `EAN` (Barcode) and `SKU`.

#### Using EAN (Barcode) as the Item Mapping Method
When the `Item Mapping Method` is set to `EAN`, each Item Variation in Plentymarkets should be set up to have a Barcode that mirrors the Wayfair Supplier Part Number that Wayfair will send in incoming order data:
1. From the main Plentymarkets page, go to `Item` >> `Edit Item`

2. Search for items to be sold on Wayfair

3. **For each Item**, click on the item in the search results, then click `Variations`

4. **For each Variation**:
    1. Click on the `Settings` tab
    2. In the `Barcode` section, pick a barcode type, then click the `Add` button, then enter the barcode value in the `Code` field. The Barcode should match the Wayfair Supplier Part Number.
    3. Click the `Save` button at the Variation level (not to be confused with the `Save` button for the Item, a few rows above)

#### Using SKU as the Item Mapping Method
When the `Item Mapping Method` is set to `SKU`, each Item Variation in Plentymarkets should be set up to have a Wayfair-specific SKU that mirrors the Wayfair Supplier Part Number that Wayfair will send in incoming order data:
1. From the main Plentymarkets page, go to `Item` >> `Edit Item`

2. Search for items to be sold on Wayfair

3. **For each Item**, click on the item in the search results, then click `Variations`

4. **For each Variation**:
    1. Click on the `Availability` tab
    2. In the `SKU` section, click the `Add` button
    3. In the pop-up window, choose `Wayfair` for the `Referrer` then enter the Wayfair Supplier Part Number in the `SKU` field, then click `Add`
    4. Click the `Save` button at the Variation level (not to be confused with the `Save` button for the Item, a few rows above)

### Import orders since
The optional `Import orders since` setting determines a date on which new Wayfair purchase orders are considered eligible for being imported into the Plentymarkets system. This setting can improve performance by preventing the Wayfair plugin from requesting orders created before the specified date. It can also be used to prevent the Plentymarkets system from accepting Orders prior to the desired "go-live date."

### Send all inventory items to Wayfair?
The optional `Send all inventory items to Wayfair?` setting determines if Plentymarkets Item Variations must be explicitly declared as eligible for sale on Wayfair or not.
When `Send all inventory items to Wayfair?` is disabled, selling an Item on Wayfair requires having "Wayfair" present in the `Markets` list of the `Availability` tab of an Item, as seen in this example:
![item with Wayfair Market](../../../images/item_wayfair_market.png)

Enabling `Send all inventory items to Wayfair?` will allow Wayfair to list any item that is determined to be currently in stock, including those Items for which "Wayfair" is **not** present in the `Markets` list.


## Full Inventory page
The `Full Inventory` page does not contain any settings to configure.
It is used for checking the status of syncing the Plentymarkets inventory with Wayfair, or manually initiating a synchronization of all inventory items.
The page's data will automatically refresh over time, but you may also manually refresh it.

**The Wayfair plugin periodically sends inventory updates to Wayfair, without any further manual activations. The Full Inventory page only displays information about the daily updates that include all items in the inventory.**

### Fields
* The `Time of last successful inventory synchronization` fields keep track of the daily synchronizations that are normally preformed automatically.
    * A "check mark" icon will appear if it has been less than 24 hours since the last successful synchronization. This indicates that no actions are required.
    * A "warning" icon will appear if it has been over 24 hours since the last successful synchronization. Consider using the `Start Synchronization` button as described below.

* The `Status of last attempt` fields are used to see if a full inventory synchronization is currently underway. Check this field after using the `Start Synchronization` button.
    * The status `COMPLETE` indicates that the last automatic or manual synchronization was successful.
    * The status `FAILED` indicates that the last automatic or manual synchronization was not successful. Check the Plentymarkets logs for issues.

### Buttons
* The `Start Synchronization` button is used for manually synchronizing all inventory. The status of the process will be displayed in the fields above the buttons.
* The `Refresh` button is used for updating the fields above the buttons to match the most recent results of automatic full inventory synchronization.


## Ship Confirmation (ASN) page
The `Ship Confirmation (ASN)` page is used for configuring the shipment interactions between Plentymarkets, the Wayfair Plugin, and Wayfair.
The information set here will inform the `Send Ship Confirmation (ASN) to Wayfair` Order Procedure that the Wayfair Plugin provides.

### Shipping type
The radio button at the top of the page has these options.
During Wayfair plugin onboarding, Wayfair will instruct on which option is appropriate for the Plentymarkets user.
* `Wayfair shipping`
    * Your orders are shipped by Wayfair
    * You only need to tell Wayfair when the order is ready for shipment
    * You need to get tracking information back from Wayfair into Plentymarkets

* `Own account shipping`
    * You ship your own orders via your own carriers
    * You need to tell Wayfair when you are shipping an order
    * You need to tell Wayfair the tracking information (carrier and tracking number)

### Matching Plentymarkets Carriers to Wayfair Carriers
When you choose the `Own Account shipping` option, Wayfair needs to translate the Plentymarkets shipping information into data it understands.
1. Locate the carrier information provided by Wayfair. Contact [ERPSupport@wayfair.com](mailto:ERPSupport@wayfair.com) if required.
2. For each Plentymarkets-side `Shipping Carrier` listed on the left-side column, enter the Wayfair-provided "SCAC code" in the right-side `Wayfair carrier` column.
3. Click `Save` at the bottom of the page
