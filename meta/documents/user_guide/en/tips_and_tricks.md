The credentials that your Plentymarkets system uses for communication with Wayfair should not be shared with anyone. You should take care to avoid doing these things:

* Forwarding Wayfair emails
* Sharing screenshots of the Global Settings for the Wayfair plugin
* Exporting the configuration of a Plugin Set that contains the Wayfair plugin
